# Rediscovering the Bible


## Vision 

To channel the authority of scripture.


## Mission

We endeavor to present the Bible to modern man from it's origins.  The Bible was not written to us.  However, it was written for us - individually and catholically.  We desire to learn biblical truths together.  Moreover, we desire to solve problems by invoking spiritual Biblical action.

## Xenodochy

He who knows not and knows not that he knows not is a fool; avoid him.  
He who knows not and knows that he knows not is a student; teach him.  
He who knows and knows not that he knows is asleep; wake him.  
He who knows and knows that he knows is a wise man; follow him.
