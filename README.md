# rediscovering_the_bible


## Vision 

To channel the authority of scripture.


## Mission

To present the Bible to modern man from it's origins.  The Bible was not written to us.  However, it was written for us - individually and catholically.  We desire to learn biblical truths.  Moreover, we desire to learn to use the Bible to solve spiritual problems through applications.
