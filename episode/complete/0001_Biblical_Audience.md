# Intro 

Welcome to Rediscovering the Bible.
We are humbled and honored to be here with you.
The purpose of this show is to To channel the authority of scripture by presenting the Bible to modern man from it's origins.
The Bible was not written to us but it was written for us.

Welcome to the inaugural episode of Rediscvering the Bible.


## What does it mean to rediscover the Bible?

It may mean:
...encountering for the first time, like so many others (including the original authors)
...reencountering it after some hiatus, I myself was "done" with church, after college, and spent a decade avoiding ministry
...renewed depth of interest in a familiar passage


## Biblical authorship

The Bible is the word of God.  A partnership with man.

The technical definition: God, through humans, via verbal plenary inspiration.

What is the Bible about?
- God with man
- Theology ~ knowing God

How did it start?
- God's chosen people
- A message for that time to those people

Why a written text?
