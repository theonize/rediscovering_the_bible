# Intro 

Welcome to Rediscovering the Bible.
We are humbled and honored to be here with you.
The purpose of this show is to To channel the authority of scripture by presenting the Bible to modern man from it's origins.
The Bible was not written to us but it was written for us.

This is our 4th episode - all about interpretation.
We can't help but interpret the Bible when we look at it - we might as well do it right.

`Reading maketh a full man; speaking a ready man; writing, an exact man.`  
  **Francis Bacon**


## Types of Interpretations

### Exegesis  
Reading _from_ the text.
We follow where the text leads and discover it's meaning;
Even if it's uncomfortable.


### Eisegesis  
Reading _into_ the text.
We insert what we know [or want] into the text.


### Narcigesis
Over-personalizing the text.
We put ourselves into the text...except when it doesn't fit our wants.
