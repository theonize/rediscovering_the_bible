## Intro
Welcome to Rediscovering the Bible. We are humbled and honored to be here with you. The purpose of this show is to To channel the authority of scripture by presenting the Bible to modern man from it's origins. The Bible was not written to us but it was written for us.

Welcome to the second episode of Rediscvering the Bible - canon and sacred writings.


# Biblical Canon

### What is canon?  
  `an authorized collection of content`

  To the Roman Catholics canon is an authoritative list of books.  
  To the protestant canon is a list of authoritative books.  


### What is a sacred text?
  `A writing of spiritual significance.`  
  
  Its significance often varies by community.


### Why were these books authorized?
  In short: only "inspired" writings were included; though certain criteria were used to establish inspiration.  
  ...inspiration can be though of as God & man working in unity.  

	1. Ecclesiastical acceptance
	2. Apostolic authorship
		a. Apostolos ~ a delegate (or messenger)
		b. Misattributed authorship always led to rejection
	3. Expositional constancy
		a. The message fits with the rest of scripture
	4. Orthodoxy
		a. The theology matches the rest of scripture


### What is the biblical Canon?
  The authorized sacred, inspired texts of the Bible.
  
  Currently:
	* 39 Old Testament books
	* 27 New Testament books
    
  In Jesus' time:
	* Pentateuch was canon (1st five books) the rest depended on your leaning
		* i.e. Sadducees held the Torah above the other books
	* Qumran scrolls included canon of all 3 major Jewish sects ~ 22/24 books
	* The Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT from 300BC) had 46 books
	* The Tanakh, Jewish scriptures:
		* Do not [always] break Samuel, King, and Chronicles into parts 1 & 2
		* May combine Ezra & Nehemiah

  Jesus mentioned the law of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms
  - [Luke 24:44]


### Who authorized them? when?
  Council of Jamnia authorized the OT canon in 250 BC
  
  The Muratorian Canon, from 170 AD, includes all modern NT books except Hebrews, James, and 3rd John.
  
  The Council of Hippo (393) and the Council of Carthage (397) both affirm the 27 books we have today.


### e.g. Hebrews
  The author of this book is unknown.  
  Hoever, it is considered apostolic in origin and is self-integrating with the canon.

### e.g. Apocrypha
  Sacred, biblical but not canon.
  It refers to Biblical, canonical scripture and talks about Biblical history events.

### e.g. The Book of Enoch (sometimes called 1st Enoch)
  The church father Origen was highly in favor of including Enoch in the complete canon.
  However, he gave up the banner when he has the only one left holding it.

### e.g. Gospel of Thomas
  Written sometime prior to 250 but the authorship is misattributed to Thomas.
  It does not align with the Bible's view of women (downplaying Mary and disaffecting womans' status in general.)
  It describes miraculous works of Jesus from a gnostic perspective.


### Will there ever be an expansion of the Biblical canon?
  What is the scope of [Revelation 22:18]()?  Does it caution against adding to the apocalypto or the entire canon (which wasn't fully established at the time of writing)?

  If the scope is only John's Apocalypse then there is a possibility.  However:
  A. There are no more apostolic writing which merit inclusion (all the one' we know of have been considered)
  B. Catholical, ecclesiastical unity in canonizing another writing seems unlikely in the denominational world


### Inspiration

  [2 Peter 1:20-21]()
  [2 Timothy 3:16]()

- Dictation (entranced)
- Verbal plenary

The fact is that God orchestrated all the events of the author's life up to, and including, the act of writing the Scripture.


### Transmission

Was the process of transmitting the word inspired?
