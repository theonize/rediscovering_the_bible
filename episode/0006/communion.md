# Communion

Some views how the sacrament of communion is processed.


### Transubstatiation
`the view that the bread and wine actually become the body and blood of Christ`

The Roman Catholic Church holds this view.
The reformers took the view that this was a re-sacrifice of God, therefor it is in error.
In fact: many reforming pastors were killed for opposing this view.


### Consubstantiation
`the view that the bread and wine become the spiritual body and blood of Christ`

Many traditions hold this view.
A problem with this view is the __magical__ nature of the bread and wine.


### Nominal?
`the modern evangelical/confessional view is the bread and wine are simply a reminder.`

Church leaders all agree that communion should be taken seriously.
This view highlights the **remembrance** aspect of the ceremony.
i.e. the very visceral act of eating and drinking correlated with the somberness of the Biblical message of Christ's sacrifice.
